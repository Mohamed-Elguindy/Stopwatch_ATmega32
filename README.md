# Stopwatch with Dual Mode

## Overview
This project implements a stopwatch with two modes: increment and countdown, using an ATmega32 microcontroller. It features a six-digit seven-segment display and control buttons for resetting, pausing, resuming, adjusting time, and switching between modes.

## Features

### Increment Mode
- Counts up from zero.

### Countdown Mode
- User sets a time, and the stopwatch counts down.

### Alarm
- A buzzer sounds when the countdown reaches zero.

### Multiplexed Display
- Six seven-segment displays controlled via multiplexing and 7447 decoder.

### Pause/Resume
- Allows pausing and resuming the stopwatch.

### Reset
- Resets the stopwatch to zero.

### Time Adjustment
- Buttons for adjusting hours, minutes, and seconds in countdown mode.

### Mode Toggle
- Switches between increment and countdown modes.

## Hardware Components

### Microcontroller

### Display
- Six multiplexed seven-segment displays (common anode) driven by a 7447 BCD to seven-segment decoder.

### Input
- **9 Push Buttons:**
  - Reset
  - Pause
  - Resume
  - Mode toggle
  - Adjust hours (increment/decrement)
  - Adjust minutes (increment/decrement)
